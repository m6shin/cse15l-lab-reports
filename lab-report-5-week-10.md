# CSE 15L Lab Report 5
## Finding the test with different results
- I ran the script.sh in the given folder and copied and pasted the result into a result.txt file.
- I ran `script.sh` on my implementation of markdown-parse and copied and pasted the result onto another result.txt file.
- Next, to find the differences, I ran `diff <Path of first result.txt> <Path of second result.txt>` in the terminal.
