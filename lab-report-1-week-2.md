## 1. Installing VScode

- Before Lab 1, I already had VScode downloaded when I took CSE 11 last fall.
- To download VScode on the computer, one goes to the site and downloads it from there.
## 2. Remotely Connecting

- In order for me to log onto my account, I needed to find my CSE 15L account and change the password.
- It also took me awhile to figure out that when typing out my password on the terminal, it will not show for security. I initially thought that there was something wrong with my account when I typed it into the terminal.
## 3. Trying Some Commands

- The main commands that I tried were cd ~, cd, ls -lat, and ls -a.
- What I learned was that cd ~ does not do anything while in home directory and ls makes a long list.
- Additionally, I tried finding the directory but an error popped up and said that something was wrong with my syntax.
## 4. Moving Files with scp

- In order to use scp, I first copied the code from WhereAmI.java and then I had to login again using the command scp.
- When i changed the code in WhereAmI.java and copied it into the remote server, it took me about 1.2 seconds for the code to run.
## 5. SSH Keys

- In order for me to set up ssh, I needed to use the command ssh-keygen and then I needed to save it on the computer.

- Since I use Windows to set up ssh, I needed to open my Powershell as the administrator and set up the ssh-agent. After setting up, ssh, I am able to log into my CSE 15L account without my password.
